# merge_sort
Merge_sort implementation in java


 In the main function we read the file,we convert the strings of the file into integers 
  and then pass them through array in order to send in to mergesort class.

/*
 Time Complexity: Sorting arrays on different machines.
Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and time complexity can be expressed as following recurrence relation.
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î˜(n)
The above recurrence can be solved either using Recurrence Tree method or Master method. 
It falls in case II of Master Method and solution of the recurrence is \Theta(nLogn).
Time complexity of Merge Sort is \Theta(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array
in two halves and take linear time to merge two halves.

    the main array. This method stops until i and j reach the limits values which means they are empty,they don't
    have more elements to compare.The remaining elements from the left side which they are sorted are coppied into the
    main array and then the merging is done.The numbers of the array are sorted.When we switch elements we count the cost,
    cost is three when the numbers which are compared are different more than two and and the cost is two when they are 
    different for one.
